# Key Principles


1. **Be specific**: Describe exactly what changed
2. **Be consistent**: Follow team conventions
3. **Be atomic**: One logical change per commit
4. **Be clear**: Write for others (including future you)
5. **Be complete**: Include why and context when needed
6. **Be conventional**: Follow standard format for automation

Good commit messages are documentation for your code's evolution. Invest time in writing them well.
