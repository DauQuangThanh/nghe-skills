description: Guides systematic code refactoring to improve code quality, maintainability, and design. Identifies code smells, applies refactoring patterns, ensures test coverage, and follows safe refactoring practices. Produces cleaner, more maintainable code while preserving functionality. Use when improving code quality, eliminating technical debt, preparing for feature additions, addressing code smells, or when users mention refactoring, code cleanup, improving design, reducing complexity, or modernizing legacy code.

# Code Refactoring

## Overview

Guides systematic code refactoring to improve code quality, maintainability, and design. Identifies code smells, applies refactoring patterns, ensures test coverage, and follows safe refactoring practices.


## Core Capabilities

1. **Code Smell Detection** - Long methods, large classes, duplicated code
2. **Refactoring Patterns** - Extract method, move method, rename
3. **Test Coverage** - Ensure tests before refactoring
4. **Safe Refactoring** - Incremental changes, continuous testing
5. **Design Improvement** - SOLID principles, design patterns


## Quick Start

**Refactoring Process:**

1. **Identify** → Find code smells (long methods, duplication)
2. **Test** → Ensure comprehensive test coverage
3. **Refactor** → Apply small, incremental improvements
4. **Verify** → Run tests after each change
5. **Commit** → Commit each successful refactoring

**Common Patterns:**
- **Extract Method** - Break long methods into smaller ones
- **Extract Class** - Split large classes into cohesive units
- **Rename** - Improve variable/method names for clarity
- **Remove Duplication** - DRY principle


## Critical Tips

1. **Test first** - Never refactor without tests
2. **Small steps** - One refactoring at a time
3. **Commit often** - Easy rollback if something breaks
4. **Preserve behavior** - Don't change functionality while refactoring
5. **Use IDE tools** - Automated refactorings are safer
