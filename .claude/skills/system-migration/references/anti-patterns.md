# Anti-Patterns


❌ **No Backups**: Migrate without backups
❌ **Big Bang**: Migrate everything simultaneously
❌ **Skip Testing**: Go straight to production
❌ **Manual Only**: No automation or scripts
❌ **Poor Documentation**: Undocumented configurations
❌ **No Rollback Plan**: Can't revert if problems occur
❌ **Ignore Dependencies**: Miss critical integrations
❌ **Insufficient Testing Time**: Rush validation phase
❌ **No Monitoring**: Can't detect issues quickly
❌ **Outdated System**: Migrate old to old (missed opportunity)
