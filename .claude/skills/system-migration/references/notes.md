# Notes


- System migrations often involve multiple skills: OS + database + application
- Plan for 30-50% more time than estimated
- Parallel run periods reduce risk but increase cost
- Mainframe migrations are multi-year projects
- Physical to virtual conversions rarely have issues with modern hardware
- Always validate hardware compatibility before OS migrations
- Document everything—configurations, decisions, issues, resolutions
