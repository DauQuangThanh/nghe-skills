# Best Practices for Backend Design Reviews


### 1. **Be Objective and Evidence-Based**
- Base feedback on established principles (RESTful design, database normalization, security best practices)
- Provide specific examples and code snippets
- Avoid subjective opinions without rationale
- Reference industry standards and guidelines

### 2. **Be Constructive and Solution-Oriented**
- Focus on problems and solutions, not personal preferences
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Offer alternatives when criticizing designs
- Balance critique with recognition of strengths

### 3. **Consider Context**
- Understand business constraints and priorities
- Consider technical feasibility and team expertise
- Respect timeline and resource limitations
- Align feedback with project goals

### 4. **Prioritize Security and Reliability**
- Security issues always high priority
- Data integrity and reliability critical
- Performance and scalability important but not at expense of security
- Consider edge cases and failure scenarios

### 5. **Think Long-Term**
- Consider maintainability and evolution
- Evaluate scalability for future growth
- Assess technical debt implications
- Plan for deprecation and migration

### 6. **Collaborate with Designers**
- Involve designers in the review process
- Encourage discussion and questions
- Be open to designer perspectives
- Work together to find best solutions

### 7. **Document Thoroughly**
- Capture all findings with clear descriptions
