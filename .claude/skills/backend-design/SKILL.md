# Backend Design

## Overview

Designs comprehensive backend systems including RESTful APIs, microservices, database architecture, authentication/authorization, caching strategies, message queues, and scalability patterns.


## Core Capabilities

1. **API Design** - REST, GraphQL, gRPC architecture
2. **Microservices Patterns** - Service decomposition, communication
3. **Database Architecture** - Schema design, data modeling
4. **Authentication/Authorization** - Security design patterns
5. **Scalability Design** - Caching, load balancing, CDN
6. **Integration Patterns** - Message queues, event-driven


## Quick Start

**Design Process:**

1. **Requirements** → Understand functional and non-functional needs
2. **Architecture** → Select patterns (monolith vs. microservices)
3. **API Design** → Define endpoints, data models, contracts
4. **Data Model** → Design database schema and relationships
5. **Security** → Plan authentication, authorization, encryption
6. **Scalability** → Design for growth, caching, load balancing


## Critical Tips

1. **Design for scalability** - Consider growth from day one
2. **API-first approach** - Design APIs before implementation
3. **Security by design** - Build security into architecture
4. **Document thoroughly** - API specs, data models, architecture diagrams
5. **Plan for failure** - Error handling, retries, circuit breakers
