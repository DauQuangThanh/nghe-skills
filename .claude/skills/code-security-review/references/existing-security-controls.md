# Existing Security Controls


✅ **Present and Effective:**
- HTTPS enforced
- Password complexity requirements
- Session timeout implemented

⚠️ **Present but Insufficient:**
- Input validation (incomplete coverage)
- Logging (missing security events)
- Error handling (exposes too much info)

❌ **Missing:**
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Security headers
- MFA support
- WAF integration
```
