# Anti-Patterns


❌ **Big Bang**: Migrate everything at once
❌ **No Testing**: Skip non-prod validation
❌ **Lift and Shift Only**: Don't optimize during migration
❌ **Ignore Costs**: Fail to estimate target platform costs
❌ **Poor Planning**: Rush without proper design
❌ **Single Point of Failure**: No redundancy during migration
❌ **Inadequate Monitoring**: Can't detect issues quickly
❌ **Forget Cleanup**: Leave resources running in both platforms
❌ **Skip Documentation**: No record of changes made
❌ **Neglect Training**: Team unprepared for new platform
