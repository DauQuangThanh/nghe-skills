# Notes


- Allow 2-3x estimated time for heterogeneous migrations
- Plan for extended parallel run period (1-4 weeks)
- Database migration often triggers application code changes
- Coordinate with application migration when possible
- Consider phased approach: read replica → read/write split → full cutover
- Cloud provider migration services often simplest for cloud migrations
