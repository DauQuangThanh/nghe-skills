# Best Practices


✅ **Multiple Backups**: Take backups before migration, keep source DB until validated
✅ **Test in Staging**: Practice migration in non-production first
✅ **Monitor Metrics**: Watch lag, throughput, errors during migration
✅ **Incremental Approach**: Migrate in phases if possible
✅ **Validate Thoroughly**: Check schema, data, and functionality
✅ **Plan for Rollback**: Always have a way back
✅ **Document Everything**: Record steps, issues, decisions
✅ **Parallel Run**: Run both databases temporarily when possible
✅ **Performance Tuning**: Optimize indexes and queries in target
✅ **Security**: Encrypt data in transit, rotate credentials
