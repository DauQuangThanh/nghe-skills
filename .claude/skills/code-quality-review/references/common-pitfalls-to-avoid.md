# Common Pitfalls to Avoid


**During Review:**
- Don't focus only on style issues - prioritize substantive problems
- Don't be overly critical without actionable suggestions
- Don't ignore context - understand business constraints
- Don't nitpick minor issues in critical code reviews
- Don't overwhelm with too many issues at once

**In Reports:**
- Don't use vague terms like "bad" or "poor" without explanation
- Don't suggest refactoring without clear benefit
- Don't ignore existing conventions without good reason
- Don't recommend changes without considering backward compatibility
- Don't forget to acknowledge good practices
