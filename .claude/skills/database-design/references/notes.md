# Notes


- Start with normalized design, denormalize only when proven necessary
- Index strategically based on actual query patterns
- Use constraints to enforce data integrity at database level
- Document design decisions and their rationale
- Plan for growth and scalability from the start
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Monitor and optimize based on production metrics
