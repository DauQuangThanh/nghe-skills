# Architecture Review Process


Follow this systematic approach when conducting architecture reviews:

### Phase 1: Pre-Review Preparation

**1. Gather Architecture Documentation**
```markdown
Required Documents:
- Architecture overview and context
- C4 diagrams (Context, Container, Component)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Technical specifications
- Non-functional requirements
- Technology stack documentation
- Data models and schemas
- API specifications
- Deployment diagrams
- Security architecture

Optional Documents:
- Performance test results
- Load test reports
- Security audit results
- Cost analysis
- Team skill matrix
```

**2. Understand Context**
```markdown
Project Context:
- Business objectives and goals
- Project constraints (budget, timeline, resources)
- Regulatory requirements
- Current system state (greenfield vs legacy)
- Team size and experience
- Timeline and milestones

Technical Context:
- Expected load and scale
- Performance requirements
- Availability targets (SLA)
- Security requirements
- Integration requirements
- Data volume and growth
```

**3. Define Review Scope**
```markdown
Review Focus Areas:
☐ Overall architecture style and patterns
☐ System decomposition and boundaries
☐ Technology stack appropriateness
☐ Scalability and performance
☐ Security architecture
☐ Data architecture
☐ Integration patterns
☐ Deployment architecture
☐ Monitoring and observability
☐ Cost optimization

Out of Scope:
- Implementation details
- Code review
- Project management
- Team processes
```

### Phase 2: Architecture Style Review

**1. Architecture Pattern Assessment**
