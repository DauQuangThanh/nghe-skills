# Design Principles


### 1. Visual Hierarchy
- **Size**: Larger elements draw more attention
- **Color**: Bright colors stand out, use sparingly
- **Contrast**: High contrast for important elements
- **Spacing**: White space separates and groups elements
- **Typography**: Weight and style create emphasis

### 2. Consistency
- Consistent component behavior across the application
- Consistent terminology and labels
- Consistent visual style and spacing
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Establish and follow design patterns

### 3. Simplicity
- Remove unnecessary elements
- Focus on essential features
- Progressive disclosure (show more as needed)
- Clear and concise copy
- Minimize cognitive load

### 4. Feedback & Response
- Immediate visual feedback for user actions
- Loading states for async operations
- Success/error messages
- Progress indicators for long processes
- Micro-interactions for delight

### 5. Error Prevention & Recovery
- Validate inputs inline
- Confirm destructive actions
- Provide clear error messages
- Offer suggestions to fix errors
- Allow undo for destructive actions

### 6. User Control
- Allow users to cancel operations
- Provide save drafts functionality
- Allow customization (themes, preferences)
- Give users control over notifications
- Respect user preferences (reduced motion, high contrast)
