# Writing Guidelines


### Clarity and Conciseness

**Use Active Voice:**
✅ "The system processes the request"
❌ "The request is processed by the system"

**Be Direct:**
✅ "Click Save to store your changes"
❌ "Your changes can be stored by clicking on the Save button"

**Avoid Redundancy:**
✅ "Configure the settings"
❌ "Configure the settings and parameters"

**Define Acronyms:**
✅ "API (Application Programming Interface)"
❌ Assume everyone knows "API"

### Consistent Terminology

**Create a glossary** for your project and use terms consistently:
- Don't alternate between "user", "customer", "client" for the same concept
- Choose one term and stick with it
- Document your glossary in a reference file

**Example:**
```markdown
