# Core Principles


**1. Know Your Audience**
- Identify reader's technical level (beginner, intermediate, expert)
- Adjust terminology, depth, and examples accordingly
- Consider reader's goals and use cases

**2. Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (define when used)
- One idea per sentence, one topic per paragraph
- Active voice preferred over passive voice

**3. Structure and Hierarchy**
- Logical organization with clear headings
- Progressive disclosure (simple → complex)
- Consistent formatting and terminology
- Scannable content with visual hierarchy

**4. Show, Don't Just Tell**
- Include concrete examples
- Provide code samples with explanations
- Use diagrams for complex concepts
- Real-world use cases and scenarios
