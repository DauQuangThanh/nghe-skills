# Maintenance


**Keep Documentation Fresh:**
- Update docs when code changes
- Review quarterly for accuracy
- Solicit user feedback regularly
- Track documentation coverage
- Deprecate outdated content

**Documentation Debt:**
Just like technical debt, documentation debt accumulates. Schedule regular maintenance sprints.

**Metrics to Track:**
- Documentation coverage (% of code/features documented)
- User feedback and satisfaction scores
- Support ticket reduction after doc updates
- Time to onboard new developers

**Remember:** Great documentation is iterative. Ship early, gather feedback, and continuously improve based on how users actually use your docs.
