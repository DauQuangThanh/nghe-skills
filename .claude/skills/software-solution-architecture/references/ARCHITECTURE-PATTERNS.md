# Architecture Patterns Reference

Detailed descriptions of common architecture patterns with use cases, benefits, and trade-offs.

## 1. Monolithic Architecture

### Description
All application components are packaged and deployed as a single unit.

### When to Use
- Small to medium applications
- Simple business domain
- Small development team
- MVP or prototypes
- Tight deadlines

### Benefits

- Easy to test end-to-end
- Simple debugging
- No network overhead
- Strong consistency

### Trade-offs
- Scaling limitations (must scale entire app)
- Technology lock-in
- Longer build and deployment times
- Difficult to maintain as size grows
- Team coordination challenges

### Example Stack
- Backend: Spring Boot monolith
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Single JAR/WAR on server

## 4. Serverless Architecture

### Description
Application logic runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered and managed by cloud provider.

### When to Use
- Variable or unpredictable workloads
- Event-driven workflows
- Rapid prototyping
- Cost optimization
- Infrequent processing

### Benefits

- Stateless constraints
- Testing challenges

### Example Stack
- Functions: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions
- API: API Gateway
- Storage: S3, DynamoDB
- Events: EventBridge, SQS

## 5. Layered (N-Tier) Architecture

### Description
Organizes application into horizontal layers, each with specific responsibility.

### Typical Layers
1. **Presentation Layer**: UI, API controllers
2. **Application Layer**: Business workflows, use cases
3. **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
4. **Data Access Layer**: Database operations
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: External services, utilities

### When to Use
- Traditional web applications
- Enterprise applications
- Clear separation of concerns needed
- Team specialization by layer

### Benefits
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand
- Testability
- Team organization
- Reusable components

### Trade-offs
- Can become monolithic
- Changes may ripple across layers
- Potentially over-engineered for simple apps
- Layer coupling risks

---

## 6. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

### Description
Places business logic at the center, with external concerns (UI, database) as adapters connected through ports.

### Core Concepts
- **Domain Core**: Business logic independent of external concerns
- **Ports**: Interfaces defining communication
- **Adapters**: Implementations of ports for specific technologies

### When to Use
- Domain-driven design
- Test-driven development
- Technology-agnostic business logic
- Long-term maintainability

### Benefits
- Technology independence
- Excellent testability
- Clear boundaries
- Easy to swap implementations
- Business logic isolation

### Trade-offs
- Initial complexity
- More abstractions
- Learning curve
- Overhead for simple apps

---

## 7. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### Description
Separates read and write operations into different models.

### When to Use
- Complex domain logic
- Different read/write patterns
- High read/write ratio disparity
- Event-sourced systems
- Need for different data representations

### Benefits
- Optimized read and write models
- Independent scaling
- Better performance
- Simplified queries
- Event-driven integration

### Trade-offs
- Increased complexity
- Eventual consistency
- Data synchronization
- More infrastructure
- Learning curve

## 8. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### Description
Services communicate through an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), providing shared business functionality.

### When to Use
- Enterprise integration
- Legacy system integration
- Shared services across organization
- Complex protocols and transformations

### Benefits
- Service reuse
- Enterprise integration
- Protocol flexibility
- Centralized governance

### Trade-offs
- ESB as single point of failure
- Performance overhead
- Complexity

## Pattern Selection Matrix

| Pattern | Complexity | Scalability | Team Size | Cost |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Monolithic | Low | Limited | Small | Low |
| Microservices | High | Excellent | Large | High |
| Event-Driven | High | Excellent | Medium-Large | Medium-High |
| Serverless | Medium | Excellent | Any | Variable |
| Layered | Low-Medium | Medium | Any | Low-Medium |
| Hexagonal | Medium | Medium | Any | Medium |
| CQRS | High | Excellent | Medium-Large | High |
| SOA | High | Good | Large | High |

## Combining Patterns

Patterns are not mutually exclusive. Common combinations:

- **Microservices + Event-Driven**: Services communicate via events
- **CQRS + Event Sourcing**: Commands create events, queries read projections
- **Hexagonal + Microservices**: Each microservice uses hexagonal internally
- **Layered + CQRS**: Separate layers for commands and queries
- **Serverless + Event-Driven**: Lambda functions triggered by events

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Distributed Monolith**: Microservices with tight coupling
2. **Anemic Domain Model**: Domain objects with no business logic
3. **God Service**: Service that does too much
4. **Chatty Services**: Too many fine-grained service calls
5. **Shared Database**: Multiple services accessing same database tables
6. **Premature Distribution**: Splitting into services too early
