# Core Capabilities


When activated, this skill enables you to:

1. **Requirements Analysis & Architecture Planning**
   - Analyze functional and non-functional requirements
   - Identify architectural drivers (scalability, security, performance)
   - Define system boundaries and constraints
   - Establish architecture goals and success criteria

2. **System Architecture Design**
   - Design layered/tiered architectures
   - Create microservices and domain-driven designs
   - Design event-driven and message-based systems
   - Plan serverless and cloud-native architectures
   - Design monolithic, modular monolithic, or distributed systems

3. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - Evaluate programming languages and frameworks
   - Select databases (SQL, NoSQL, time-series, graph)
   - Choose middleware and integration platforms
   - Select infrastructure and cloud platforms
   - Recommend CI/CD and DevOps tools

4. **Architecture Patterns & Best Practices**
   - Apply design patterns (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal)
   - Implement integration patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, message queues)
   - Design for scalability (horizontal/vertical, caching, CDN)
   - Implement security patterns (OAuth, JWT, zero-trust)
   - Apply resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads)

5. **Documentation & Deliverables**
   - Create C4 model diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Code)
   - Generate UML diagrams (class, sequence, deployment)
   - Produce architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - Write technical specifications and API contracts
   - Create implementation roadmaps and migration plans
