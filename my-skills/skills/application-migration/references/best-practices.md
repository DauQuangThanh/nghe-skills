# Best Practices


### Do's

✅ **Start Small**: Pilot with non-critical functionality first
✅ **Automate**: Infrastructure, deployment, testing, data migration
✅ **Monitor Continuously**: Metrics, logs, user feedback
✅ **Test Thoroughly**: All test types, especially performance and data validation
✅ **Communicate Often**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout
✅ **Plan for Rollback**: Always have a backup plan
✅ **Document Everything**: Architecture, procedures, decisions
✅ **Involve Users Early**: Get feedback during UAT
✅ **Use Feature Flags**: Enable gradual rollout and easy rollback
✅ **Celebrate Milestones**: Recognize team achievements

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't Rush**: Allow adequate time for testing and validation
❌ **Don't Skip Testing**: Every shortcut increases risk
❌ **Don't Migrate Everything**: Retire unused functionality
❌ **Don't Over-Engineer**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
❌ **Don't Ignore Data Quality**: Fix issues before migration
❌ **Don't Forget Compliance**: Security, privacy, regulatory requirements
❌ **Don't Underestimate Complexity**: Build in buffer for unknowns
❌ **Don't Neglect Training**: Users and support team need preparation
❌ **Don't Lose Legacy Knowledge**: Document before experts leave
❌ **Don't Declare Victory Too Early**: Stabilization takes time
