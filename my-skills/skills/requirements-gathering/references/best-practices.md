# Best Practices


### Requirements Quality Checklist
- [ ] **Clear**: Unambiguous and easy to understand
- [ ] **Complete**: All necessary information included
- [ ] **Consistent**: No contradictions with other requirements
- [ ] **Testable**: Can verify when implemented correctly
- [ ] **Feasible**: Technically and economically possible
- [ ] **Necessary**: Directly supports business goals
- [ ] **Prioritized**: Classified by importance
- [ ] **Traceable**: Linked to source and downstream artifacts

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Solution-Focused**: Describing HOW instead of WHAT
   - ❌ "System must use React framework"
   - ✅ "System must provide responsive web interface"

2. **Vague Language**: Using ambiguous terms
   - ❌ "System should be fast"
   - ✅ "System must respond within 2 seconds"

3. **Gold Plating**: Including unnecessary features
   - Focus on business value
   - Apply 80/20 rule
   - Challenge "nice to have" features

4. **Assuming Knowledge**: Not documenting obvious things
   - Document all assumptions
   - Define acronyms and terminology
   - Provide context

5. **Skipping Validation**: Not confirming understanding
   - Review requirements with stakeholders
   - Create prototypes for complex features
   - Get sign-off before development
